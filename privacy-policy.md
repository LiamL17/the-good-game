# Privacy Policy for The Good Game
This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in The Good Game.

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect

Our app is designed to be a completely offline experience. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Location data
- Device identifiers

We have no servers, third-party analytics, or advertising services that collect data from your use of the app. All game data, including your scores and progress, is stored exclusively on your device.

## 2. Local Data Storage
The app stores your game data (such as scores, progress, and settings) locally on your device to enable features like your local leaderboard and saved game state. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.

## 3. Future Changes

As your game evolves and we introduce new features, such as online accounts and leaderboards, this Privacy Policy will need to be updated. When we make significant changes, we will notify you and provide a new, updated policy that clearly explains what data is being collected and how it is being used.

## 4. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at liam.louw17@gmail.com.
